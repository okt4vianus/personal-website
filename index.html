          Hey there! I'm a Remote Positioning Engineer with over a decade of
          experience in the oil and gas industry, currently making waves at
          Fugro Indonesia. Since 2014, I’ve been driving success as an AVTS
          Coordinator for TOTAL E&P Indonesia and as an AVTS Engineer for
          Pertamina Hulu Mahakam, focusing on Automatic Vessel Tracking Systems
          (AVTS) and optimizing maritime logistics. I kicked off my career as a
          Software Engineer at TOTAL E&P Indonesia from 2010 to 2013, where I
          kept a close eye on transportation systems, managed personnel
          solutions, and built comprehensive marine crew databases. I also
          created insightful reports and led training sessions for users and
          technical support teams, boosting operational efficiency. Before that,
          I was at Alita Process in partnership with Astrata as a Product and
          Software Engineer from 2006 to 2009. I managed tech teams to craft
          detailed mapping solutions and rolled out GPS tech for customer
          vehicles. My experience in quality assurance, user acceptance testing,
          and technical presentations laid a solid foundation in both software
          development and client relations. I started my journey as a Network
          Engineer, tackling support and troubleshooting for computer systems
          and maintaining existing networks—this was where I really sharpened my
          technical skills. Throughout my career, I’ve embraced the challenge of
          adapting to new technologies and industry shifts. I’m all about
          sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration, making sure best
          practices are a priority. I thrive in dynamic environments that push
          me to innovate and grow, always on the lookout for new tech to explore
          and apply.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              Hey there! I'm a Remote Positioning Engineer with over a decade of
              experience in the oil and gas industry, currently making waves at
              Fugro Indonesia. Since 2014, I’ve been driving success as an AVTS
              Coordinator for TOTAL E&P Indonesia and as an AVTS Engineer for
              Pertamina Hulu Mahakam, focusing on Automatic Vessel Tracking
              Systems (AVTS) and optimizing maritime logistics.
            </p>

            <p>
              I kicked off my career as a Software Engineer at TOTAL E&P
              Indonesia from 2010 to 2013, where I kept a close eye on
              transportation systems, managed personnel solutions, and built
              comprehensive marine crew databases. I also created insightful
              reports and led training sessions for users and technical support
              teams, boosting operational efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before that, I was at Alita Process in partnership with Astrata as
              a Product and Software Engineer from 2006 to 2009. I managed tech
              teams to craft detailed mapping solutions and rolled out GPS tech
              for customer vehicles. My experience in quality assurance, user
              acceptance testing, and technical presentations laid a solid
              foundation in both software development and client relations.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started my journey as a Network Engineer, tackling support and
              troubleshooting for computer systems and maintaining existing
              networks—this was where I really sharpened my technical skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout my career, I’ve embraced the challenge of adapting to
              new technologies and industry shifts. I’m all about sharing
              knowledge and fostering collaboration, making sure best practices
              are a priority. I thrive in dynamic environments that push me to
              innovate and grow, always on the lookout for new tech to explore
              and apply.
